# 3D Band Structure Workflow for VASP

This repository provides a complete Python-based workflow to generate and visualize **3D band structure surfaces** from **VASP** simulations. It is especially useful for large supercells (such as graphene + COF systems), where accurate resolution of small band gaps and Dirac cone features is critical.

## 📁 Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kpoints_gui_weighted.py` | GUI tool for creating custom or weighted k-point meshes, including Dirac-cone refinement. |
| `kpoints_grid.py`         | Extracts k-point coordinates and HOMO/LUMO band energies from VASP outputs and generates `.grd` files for plotting. |
| `visualization.py`        | Visualizes the band surface data from `.grd` files as 2D or 3D energy surfaces. |

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

This workflow proceeds in four main steps:

1. Generate a custom k-point mesh with a GUI
2. Run a VASP band structure calculation
3. Extract structured grid data (k-points and bands)
4. Visualize the 3D band surfaces (HOMO and LUMO)

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Generate Weighted KPOINTS File

Run:

```bash
python3 kpoints_gui_weighted.py
```

### 🎛️ GUI Features:

- Define `kx`, `ky`, and `kz` grid dimensions (e.g., `20×20×1`)
- Add **refined sampling** around high-symmetry points (e.g., Γ, K, or M) — useful for capturing Dirac cones or flat bands
- Option to **weight k-points** (for denser sampling in select regions) or generate a **uniform grid**
- Preview k-point grid before export
- Export a standard VASP-compatible `KPOINTS` file with weighted or uniform entries

📄 **Output:** A `KPOINTS` file to be used directly in a VASP run.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Run VASP Calculation

Use the generated `KPOINTS` file in your simulation directory and configure your `INCAR` file appropriately.

### 🔧 Example `INCAR` settings:

```ini
ENCUT  = 375
PREC   = Accurate
ISMEAR = 0
SIGMA  = 0.01
LWAVE  = .TRUE.
LCHARG = .TRUE.
LREAL  = Auto
```

Ensure your VASP run produces the following outputs:

- `EIGENVAL` — Band energies
- `KPOINTS` — The k-point mesh used
- `FERMI_ENERGY` — *(optional)* A single-line text file containing the Fermi level in eV (can be manually extracted from `OUTCAR`)
- `WAVECAR`, `CHGCAR` — For reuse if needed

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Extract Grid Data for Visualization

After your VASP run completes, execute:

```bash
python3 kpoints_grid.py
```

### 📦 Outputs:

- `KX.grd`, `KY.grd`: Meshgrid of reciprocal-space k-points
- `BAND_HOMO.grd`: Energy values of the HOMO band at each k-point
- `BAND_LUMO.grd`: Energy values of the LUMO band at each k-point

✅ If `FERMI_ENERGY` is provided, the energies are shifted relative to the Fermi level.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Visualize 3D Band Surfaces

Run:

```bash
python3 visualization.py
```

This script loads the `.grd` files and produces 2D and 3D visualizations of the band structure.

### 📊 Features:

- 3D surface plots for `BAND_HOMO` and `BAND_LUMO` over k-space
- Visual comparison of conduction and valence band features
- Detection of band gap size and location
- Visualization of Dirac cone behavior or flat band regions
- Optional export or saving of plots

---

## 💡 Typical Use Case

You can use this workflow to:
- Investigate small band gaps (~10 meV) induced by perturbations in graphene-like systems
- Resolve Dirac cone features in reciprocal space
- Compare HOMO and LUMO energy distributions over a dense k-mesh

---

## 📥 Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pyvista
```

Also requires:
- `tkinter` (for GUI; comes preinstalled with most Python distributions)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Use `ENCUT ≥ 375` and `PREC = Accurate` to resolve small band gaps reliably.
- Reusing `CHGCAR` across ENCUTs is allowed, but **`WAVECAR` must match ENCUT** to be reused.
- You can modify `kpoints_grid.py` to extract bands other than HOMO/LUMO if needed.
- `.grd` files are NumPy-readable plain text arrays.

---

## 🧠 Tips for Memory-Limited Systems

- Reduce ENCUT to 350–375 eV (but no lower for small-gap systems)
- Use `LREAL = Auto` or `.TRUE.` to save RAM
- Use `NELM = 1`, `ICHARG = 11` for a single-step band-only run after preconverging charge density
