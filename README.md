# 3D-Bandstructure-for-VASP
This repository contains scripts to generate and visualize 3D band structure data from VASP simulations, particularly suited for large supercells (e.g., graphene + COF systems). The scripts automate k-point mesh creation, data extraction from VASP output files, and visual representation of band structures.
